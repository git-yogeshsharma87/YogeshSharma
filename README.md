My name is Yogesh and I'm a software professional. I have a passion for learning and sharing my knowledge with others in a way that's as public as possible. I love technology and helping people. I really like boyscout rule.
Certified in multiple tools, technologies and agile processes, I write and share what I am familiar with.
